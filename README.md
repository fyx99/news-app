# News Aggregator App

This is a simple News Aggregator app built using **React Native** for the frontend and **Express** for the backend. The app allows users to view a feed of news articles and view detailed news articles on a separate page.

## Features

- **News Feed**: Displays a list of aggregated news articles.
- **News Article Detail Page**: Displays the content of a selected news article using an embedded web browser.
- **React Native WebView**: The article detail is shown in a web view embedded in the app.

## Requirements

- **Node.js** (for Express server)
- **React Native** (for mobile app)
- **Expo CLI** (optional but recommended for easier React Native development)

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/news-aggregator-app.git
cd news-aggregator-app
```
### 2. Backend (Express)
Navigate to the backend folder (or wherever your Express server code is).

Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```
Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

The Express server should now be running and serving the aggregated news data.

3. Frontend (React Native)
Install the dependencies for the React Native app:
bash

cd frontend
npm install
Start the React Native app (if using Expo):
bash

expo start
Or, if you're using React Native CLI:

bash

npx react-native run-android   # for Android
npx react-native run-ios       # for iOS

4. Configuration
Ensure that the React Native app is properly configured to fetch data from your Express backend. You might need to set the backend URL in your frontend configuration.

js
Copy code
// In your frontend code, typically in an API service file
const backendURL = 'http://localhost:3000';  // Adjust to your backend server URL
Screens
Feed Screen
Displays a list of aggregated news articles.
Each item is clickable and will navigate to the News Article Detail Page.
News Article Detail Page
Shows a detailed view of the selected news article.
Uses React Native's WebView component to display the full content of the article inside the app.
